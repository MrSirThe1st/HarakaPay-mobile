# HarakaPay Mobile App Design Policy

## Parent-Centric Mobile Design Philosophy

The HarakaPay mobile app serves a fundamentally different audience and use case than the web portal. While the web version targets schools and administrators with enterprise-grade functionality, the mobile app is designed for parents who need quick, secure, and intuitive access to their children's school fee information.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. **Mobile-First Accessibility**
- **Touch-optimized interfaces**: Minimum 44px touch targets following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
- **One-handed operation**: Critical actions accessible within thumb reach on typical screen sizes
- **Parent-friendly navigation**: Shallow information hierarchy with maximum 3 levels deep
- **Quick access patterns**: Most common tasks (check balance, make payment) accessible within 2 taps from home

### 2. **Trust & Security Visual Language**
- **Financial confidence**: Use visual cues that communicate security and reliability
- **Transparent processes**: Clear visual feedback for all payment states and confirmations
- **Professional credibility**: Maintain enterprise-grade visual quality adapted for mobile consumption
- **Error prevention**: Generous use of confirmation dialogs and clear action previews

### 3. **Multi-Child Management Focus**
- **Child-centric organization**: Design around managing multiple children as primary use case
- **Visual hierarchy**: Clear distinction between children and their respective schools
- **Quick switching**: Seamless navigation between children's accounts
- **Consolidated views**: Dashboard showing aggregate information across all children

## Visual Design System

### Typography
- **Primary font**: IBM Plex Sans
- **Mobile optimization**: Larger base font sizes (16px minimum) for readability
- **Hierarchy**: 
  - H1: 24px (page titles)
  - H2: 20px (section headers)
  - Body: 16px (primary content)
  - Caption: 14px (secondary information)

### Color Palette
- **Primary brand**: #0080FF (rgba(0,128,255,255)) - used sparingly for CTAs and key actions
- **Mobile adaptations**:
  - Success states: #00C851 (payment confirmations)
  - Warning states: #FF8800 (payment reminders)
  - Error states: #FF4444 (failed transactions)
  - Neutral base: #F8F9FA (background)
  - Text primary: #1D1D1F (high contrast for mobile screens)

### Layout & Spacing
- **Grid system**: 16px base unit for consistent spacing
- **Mobile margins**: 16px side margins, 24px vertical sections
- **Card-based design**: Information grouped in clear, tappable cards
- **Generous whitespace**: Prevent cognitive overload for busy parents

## Mobile-Specific UX Patterns

### 1. **Dashboard Design**
- **Summary cards**: Quick overview of all children's fee status
- **Action-oriented**: Prominent payment buttons when fees are due
- **Notification center**: Centralized view of all school communications
- **Quick stats**: Visual indicators for paid/pending amounts across children

### 2. **Payment Flow**
- **Progressive disclosure**: Step-by-step payment process with clear progress indicators
- **Payment method selection**: Large, visual buttons for M-Pesa, Airtel Money, Orange Money
- **Confirmation screens**: Multiple confirmation steps with amount breakdown
- **Receipt generation**: Immediate digital receipt with share functionality

### 3. **Child Management Interface**
- **Profile cards**: Visual representation of each child with photo and key info
- **School context**: Clear indication of which school each child attends
- **Quick actions**: Swipe gestures for common tasks per child
- **Status indicators**: Visual badges for payment status, notifications, etc.

### 4. **Communication Hub**
- **Message prioritization**: Important notices highlighted prominently
- **Rich media support**: Handle images, PDFs, and attachments from schools
- **Notification management**: Granular control over push notification preferences
- **Archive system**: Easy access to historical communications

## Mobile vs Web Differentiation

### Mobile App (Parent-focused)
- **Consumption-oriented**: Optimized for viewing and responding to information
- **Task-specific**: Quick actions like payments, checking balances, reading notifications
- **Personal**: Individual parent managing their children's accounts
- **Convenience**: On-the-go access with offline capabilities where possible

### Web Portal (School-focused)
- **Management-oriented**: Complex administrative tasks and bulk operations
- **Data-intensive**: Spreadsheets, reports, and detailed analytics
- **Professional**: Multi-user environments with role-based permissions
- **Comprehensive**: Full-featured administration and configuration tools

## Component Design Standards

### Navigation
- **Tab bar navigation**: Maximum 5 primary sections
- **Contextual navigation**: Floating action buttons for primary actions in each section
- **Breadcrumbs**: Minimal breadcrumb system for deeper navigation
- **Back gestures**: Support iOS swipe-back and Android hardware back button

### Forms & Input
- **Large input fields**: Generous touch targets with clear labels
- **Smart keyboards**: Appropriate keyboard types for different inputs
- **Validation**: Real-time, inline validation with helpful error messages
- **Autocomplete**: Smart suggestions for repeated information

### Feedback & States
- **Loading states**: Skeleton screens during data fetching
- **Empty states**: Helpful illustrations and actions when no data exists
- **Success states**: Clear confirmation with next step suggestions
- **Error handling**: Graceful error messages with recovery options

## Accessibility Requirements

### Universal Access
- **Color contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for all text

## Implementation Guidelines

### Design Token Structure
```javascript

    xs: 4,
    sm: 8,
    md: 16,
    lg: 24,
    xl: 32
  },
  colors: {
    primary: '#0080FF',
    success: '#00C851',
    warning: '#FF8800',
    error: '#FF4444'
  },
  typography: {
    fontFamily: 'IBM Plex Sans',
    sizes: {
      body: 16,
      caption: 14,
      h2: 20,
      h1: 24
    }
  }
}
```

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Small phones**: 320px - 375px width

## Quality Assurance Standards

### User Testing Requirements
- **Parent usability**: Regular testing with actual parents in Congo
